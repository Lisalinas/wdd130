            <li>MOON CYCLES GUIDED JOURNAL
            It's A Phase We're Moving Through
            Use this guided journal to follow the shifting phases of the moon and to chart your emotions as you move through time and space. The moon is always up to something—connect the dots between your experience in the world and the moon's cycle.
            The journal is divided by sections based on moon phase. You can dip in and out anytime, and use it for years, because it doesn't include calendar dates. Each section starts with the moon phase and a prompt to help you start writing. Cosmically and eternally, the moon is always by your side.
            Written, Designed, and printed in the USA.</li>
