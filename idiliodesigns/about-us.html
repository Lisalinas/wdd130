                <p>Idilio is a studio located in the state of Arizona, in which Jazmin Nye, a latin artist from Colombia creates
                and expresses how beautiful the complex of life is, by using illustrations and words. You can find those
                expressions through journals, prints, stickers, and accessories created and manufactured in the USA.
                Idilio began in 2022 when Jazmin Nye decided to put aside her dead end routine without color to return
                to her childhood creativity and led her to dream of inspiring and connecting people one day. </p>

            <div class="paragraph2">
                <p>Every phrase and stroke of her designs will           recreate     
                connections and feelings like in the old days, when no one
                was ashamed to open their minds and hearts.
                Every time you buy a product from our Idilio brand, you are helping to improve the lives of children and
                young people with disabilities in Colombia, as Idilio Designs will donate 10% of its profits to foundations
                dedicated to helping this vulnerable population.
                We care about what you think. We want to talk to you and be helpful so you can write to our email idiliodesigns@correo.com</p>
