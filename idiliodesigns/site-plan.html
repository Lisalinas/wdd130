      <h3>ABOUT</h3>
      <p>
        [I decided to dedicate this page to show what Idilio is and the value that each client brings to the
        company]
        Idilio is a studio located in the state of Arizona, in which Jazmin Nye, a latin artist from Colombia creates
        and expresses how beautiful the complex of life is, by using illustrations and words. You can find those
        expressions through journals, prints, stickers, and accessories created and manufactured in the USA.
        Idilio began in 2022 when Jazmin Nye decided to put aside her dead end routine without color to return
        to her childhood creativity and led her to dream of inspiring and connecting people one day. Every
        phrase and stroke of her designs will recreate connections and feelings like in the old days, when no one
        was ashamed to open their minds and hearts.
        Every time you buy a product from our Idilio brand, you are helping to improve the lives of children and
        young people with disabilities in Colombia, as Idilio Designs will donate 10% of its profits to foundations
        dedicated to helping this vulnerable population.
        We care about what you think. We want to talk to you and be helpful so this space is for you: (I will
        create some boxes for customers to write their questions, complaints, or suggestions) … Or if you prefer
        write to our email idiliodesigns@gmail.com.

      <h3>PRODUCTS</h3>
      <p>
        [In this title a menu will be displayed with the following options: Journals, Prints and Stickers, and
        Accessories.]
        On this page, customers will have the opportunity to explore a series of products with exclusive designs
        for our brand. They will be able to see a catalog for each section. By clicking on each option, a picture and text with a 
        description of size, weight, and material will be displayed.The image and text will be located in the center of the page. Two boxes will appear under the text with the options: "Quantity" and "Add to cart”.
        The objective on this page is to display a series of professional photos of each product, highlighting the colors
        and quality of the material so that the customer is engaged in each section.
        When the client clicks on each of the options, the initial page will smoothly transition to page 2 where the content will be displayed. In the header, the option to return to the home page will appear; the customer can click again on another menu option aswell. In the footer, the same format will be maintained on each page, showing the icons of the social media that the store currently manages, ways to contact the brand, FAQs, and terms and conditions.
