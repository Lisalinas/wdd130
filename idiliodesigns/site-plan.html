            Use this guided journal to follow the shifting phases of the moon and to chart your emotions as you move through time and space. The moon is always up to something—connect the dots between your experience in the world and the moon's cycle.
            The journal is divided by sections based on moon phase. You can dip in and out anytime, and use it for years, because it doesn't include calendar dates. Each section starts with the moon phase and a prompt to help you start writing. Cosmically and eternally, the moon is always by your side.

      <h3>About us</h3>
      <p>
        Idilio is a studio located in the state of Arizona, in which Jazmin Nye, a latin artist from Colombia creates
        and expresses how beautiful the complex of life is, by using illustrations and words. You can find those
        expressions through journals, prints, stickers, and accessories created and manufactured in the USA.
        Idilio began in 2022 when Jazmin Nye decided to put aside her dead end routine without color to return
        to her childhood creativity and led her to dream of inspiring and connecting people one day. Every
        phrase and stroke of her designs will recreate connections and feelings like in the old days, when no one
        was ashamed to open their minds and hearts.
        Every time you buy a product from our Idilio brand, you are helping to improve the lives of children and
        young people with disabilities in Colombia, as Idilio Designs will donate 10% of its profits to foundations
        dedicated to helping this vulnerable population.
        We care about what you think. We want to talk to you and be helpful so this space is for you. Or if you prefer
        write to our email idiliodesigns@gmail.com.
