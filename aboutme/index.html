 <h2>Liseth Salinas</h2> <p>Hello everyone!</p>
 <p>I am from Colombia. I have been living in the United States for 4 years. I currently live with my husband in Arizona with a rescue dog that we adopted 5 months ago. I'm studying Applied Technology, this is my first semester. I am very excited and nervous at the same time because I have never studied anything related to programming or coding. In addition, I am still learning English. So everything is very challenging but I love all the blessings that God has put in my way to be able to grow and in the future help many people including my family. I like painting and drawing. I love the oportunity to have a degree online in BYU-Idaho because it brings a lot of bennefits like saving money and time.</p>
